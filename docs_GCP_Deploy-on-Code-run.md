# Deploy on Cloud Run

Two of the three competition tasks — `Tripletex` and `Astar Island` — require you to host a public `HTTPS` endpoint that the validators call. `Cloud Run` is the easiest way to deploy one.

## What is Cloud Run?

`Cloud Run` takes a Docker container and gives you a public `HTTPS` URL. You push your code, and it handles scaling, `TLS`, and everything else. You only pay for actual requests (and with your `GCP` account, it's free).

## Step 1: Write Your Endpoint

Here's a minimal `FastAPI` endpoint that matches the competition format:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/health")
def health():
    return {"status": "ok"}

@app.post("/solve")
async def solve(request: dict):
    prompt = request.get("prompt", "")
    credentials = request.get("tripletex_credentials", {})

    # Your AI agent logic here:
    # 1. Parse the prompt
    # 2. Call the Tripletex API using the provided credentials
    # 3. Complete the accounting task

    return {"status": "completed"}
```

## Step 2: Create a Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .

CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]
```

And a `requirements.txt`:

```text
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
requests
```

## Step 3: Deploy

Open `Cloud Shell` and run:

```bash
# Clone your repo (or upload files via Cloud Shell Editor)
cd ~
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd your-project

# Deploy to Cloud Run (builds and deploys in one command)
gcloud run deploy my-agent \
  --source . \
  --region europe-north1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --memory 1Gi \
  --timeout 300
```

That's it. `Cloud Run` builds the Docker image, deploys it, and gives you a URL like:

```text
https://my-agent-xxxxx-lz.a.run.app
```

## Step 4: Submit Your URL

- Copy the `Cloud Run` URL
- Go to the submission page for your task at `app.ainm.no`
- Paste the URL and submit
- The validators will start calling your endpoint

## Tips

### Use `europe-north1` Region

Deploy in `europe-north1` (`Finland`) — same region as the validators. Lower latency = faster scoring.

```bash
gcloud run deploy my-agent --region europe-north1 ...
```

### Handle Cold Starts

`Cloud Run` scales to zero when idle. The first request after idle may take a few seconds. To keep it warm:

```bash
gcloud run deploy my-agent --min-instances 1 ...
```

This keeps one instance always running — useful during active competition.

### Increase Memory for LLMs

If you're calling external `LLM` APIs (like `Vertex AI`), the default `512 MB` is fine. If you're running a local model, increase memory:

```bash
gcloud run deploy my-agent --memory 2Gi --cpu 2 ...
```

### Update Your Deployment

After making changes, just run the same deploy command again:

```bash
gcloud run deploy my-agent --source . --region europe-north1 --allow-unauthenticated
```

`Cloud Run` builds and deploys a new revision automatically.

### View Logs

Check what your endpoint is doing:

```bash
gcloud run services logs read my-agent --region europe-north1 --limit 50
```

Or view logs in the `Cloud Console` under your service → `Logs` tab.

## Which Tasks Need Cloud Run?

| Task | Submission type | Cloud Run? |
|---|---|---|
| `Tripletex` | HTTPS endpoint (`/solve`) | Yes |
| `Astar Island` | HTTPS endpoint (`/solve`) | Yes |
| `NorgesGruppen Data` | Code upload (`.zip`) | No |
